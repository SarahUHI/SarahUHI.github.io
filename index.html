                The "dandy horse", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to
                use only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais. It is regarded as the
                first bicycle, but it did not have pedals;
            </p>

                The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan,
                a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.

                The Svea Velocipede with vertical pedal arrangement and locking hubs was introduced in 1892 by the
                Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungström and Birger Ljungström. It attracted attention at the World Fair
                and was produced in a few thousand units.

                From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses. In a
                utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, bicycle commuting, and utility cycling. It can
                be used as a 'work horse', used by mail carriers, paramedics, police, messengers, and general delivery
                services. Military uses of bicycles include communications, reconnaissance, troop movement, supply of
                provisions, and patrol. See also: bicycle infantry.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as bicycle touring, mountain biking, physical
                fitness, and play. Bicycle competition includes racing, BMX racing, track racing, criterium, roller racing,
                sportives and time trials. Major multi-stage professional events are the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France,
                the Vuelta a España, the Tour de Pologne, and the Volta a Portugal.

                    Lowracers are a type of recumbent more common in Europe among racing enthusiasts. These typically
                    have two 20" wheels or a 26" wheel at the rear and 20" wheel at the front. The seat is positioned between
                    the wheels rather than above them. The extreme reclined position, and the fact that the rider is sitting
                    in line with the wheels rather than atop them, makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Highracers are distinguished by using two large wheels (usually ISO 559, 650c or 700c). This necessitates
                    a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider's legs are above the front wheel, and this in
                    turn requires a higher seat. The seating position may be otherwise identical to that on a lowracer allowing
                    similar aerodynamics. "Racer" in the name implies that this will often be the case, since these bikes strive
                    for speed.

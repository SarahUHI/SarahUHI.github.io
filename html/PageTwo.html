                The wheel is usually similar to a bicycle wheel with a special hub designed so the axle is a
                fixed part of the hub. This means the rotation of the cranks directly controls the rotation of the
                wheel (called direct drive). The frame sits on top of the axle bearings, while the cranks attach to
                the ends of the axle, and the seatpost slides into the frame to allow the saddle to be height adjusted.

                Generally used for flatland skills and freestyle routines, freestyle unicycles typically have a
                relatively high seatpost, a narrow saddle, and a squared fork (used for one-footed tricks). These
                unicycles are used similarly to flatland bicycles. Wheel size is usually 20 inches (510 mm), but
                smaller riders may use 16-or-12-inch (410 or 300 mm) unicycles. Some people prefer 24-inch (610 mm)
                wheels.

                Designed for unicycle trials, these unicycles are stronger than standard unicycles in order to
                withstand the stresses caused by jumping, dropping, and supporting the weight of the unicycle and
                rider on components such as the pedals and cranks. Many trials unicycles also have wide, 19- or
                20-inch (510 mm) knobby tires to absorb some of the impact on drops.

                Mountain unicycling (abbreviated to muni or mUni) consists of riding specialized unicycles on
                mountain bike trails or otherwise off-roading. Mountain unicycles have thicker, wider tires for
                better traction. Riders may occasionally lower air pressure for increased shock absorption.
                Many riders choose to use long cranks to increase power when riding up hills and over rough terrain.
                A disc brake is sometimes used for descents; the brake handle is attached to the underside of
                the handle on the front of the saddle.

                Traditionally, unicycling has been seen as a circus skill which has been performed at events
                to entertain the public in the circus or during parades, carnivals or street festivals. Recent
                developments in the strength and durability of bicycle (and consequently unicycle) parts have
                given rise to many new activities including trials unicycling and mountain unicycling. Unicycling
                is arguably now as much a competitive sport and recreational pursuit as an entertainment activity.

                <p>Numerous health medical groups support helmet laws. These include the World Health Organization,</p>

                <p>
                    Cycling Action Network (New Zealand) policy states "There is evidence that mandatory cycle helmet
                    wearing legislation is not working as intended and should be reviewed. Priority needs to be given to
                    other safety issues such as motorist behaviour and roading improvements."
